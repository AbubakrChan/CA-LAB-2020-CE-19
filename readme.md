### Note:
I initially completed the 5-stage RISC processor but later the final project was changed please examine the 3-stage-pipelined folder now.

**RISC-V 3-Stage Pipeline Processor Overview**

This repository showcases a 3-stage pipelined Processor developed using System Verilog. The processor supports a variety of instructions, including:

1. Basic types: R, I, B, S, LOADS, J, and U.
2. CSR instructions for control and status registers.

The processor is equipped to manage data hazards through mechanisms like forwarding and stalling. It also supports instruction flushing.

For comprehensive details, refer to the documentation located in the 'docs' folder.

**Dependencies:**

1. `make` command
2. `vsim` (Mentor's QuestaSim Simulator)
3. `xrun` (Cadence Xcelium) - Note: This is a premium version.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   https://github.com/AhsanAliUet/riscv-3-stage-pipelined-processor-core.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the 'sim' directory. Here, input your assembly code into the `asm_code.s` file intended for testing on the processor. Ensure your assembly code is free of errors.

3. Using your terminal (Powershell, bash, etc.), execute:
   ```
   make run
   ```
   This command will initiate the execution of your assembly program on the 3-stage processor and display the register file and data memory results on the terminal.

4. To visualize the waveforms generated by the processor due to your assembly program:
   ```
   make wave
   ```
   This will present the waveforms in gtkwave.

**Linux Users:**

- Ensure you use `Makefile_Linux` and have Cadence Xcelium set up on your Linux machine.
  
- To convert assembly code to machine code, use:
  ```
  make -f Makefile_Linux conv_to_machine
  ```

- For command-line execution:
  ```
  make -f Makefile_Linux run_cli
  ```

- To run the core via the Cadence Xcelium GUI (ensure you have the software):
  ```
  make -f Makefile_Linux run_gui
  ```

For any inquiries or issues related to the processor, please contact me at [your contact details].

### 5- Staged (Extra)

This is a 16-bit, 5-stage RISC processor. RTL description in Verilog. Includes assembler, simulator, and example programs.

### Overview
This project is about a 16-bit processor made using Verilog, which has five main stages: instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and register writeback. The processor uses the Harvard architecture, meaning it has separate memories for programs and data. If there's a data issue called a RAW hazard, the processor might pause. 

There's also a simulator for this processor made with Verilator, an open-source tool available on Github or through Ubuntu. Plus, there's a Python tool in the project that turns programs in the swt16 assembly language into machine code.

## Directory structure
```
├── bench        : Simulator directory
├── doc          : ISA documentation
├── prog         : Example / test programs
├── README.md    : This readme
├── rtl          : Processor description in Verilog
└── utils        : Utilities: automated tests
```

To install Verilator, GTKWAVE, and Python, execute the following command (on Ubuntu Linux):

sudo apt-get install verilator gtkwave python

Example simulation run:

./swt16/Vswt16_top --simTime 200 --pmemFile ../prog/test_load_store.pmem --dmemFile ../prog/test_load_store.dmem --dmemDump

In this example, --simTime <timeUnits> specifies the number of time units for which the simulation is run. The option --pmemFile <filename> specifies the program file that is loaded into the program memory. Similarly, --dmemFile <filename> specifies the data file that is loaded into the data memory.

### Writing a program
This project contains an assembler written in Python. The assembler generates machine code for the processor from programs written in the swt16 assembly language. To invoke the assembler, execute the following:

cd utils && python asm.py -i <asm_file> -o <machine_code_file>

You can try out the assember by regenerating the machine code test programs located in [prog]. For example, to regenerate the machine code for the factorial test program, execute the following:

cd utils && python asm.py -i ../prog/test_factorial.asm

Refer to [doc/ISA.odt] for an overview of the current state of the assembly language and the ISA.

Note: This project is developed and tested using Ubuntu Linux.
